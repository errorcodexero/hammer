	-Make the controls work as if we had the data
		~For targets
		~For ball locations
Shooter wheels:
	-Determine the actual speeds to use
	-Add option to use config file
	-Add fallback systems
	-Revise jag code
	-Change how the shooter wheels are controlled to make one of them just on at some % and the other one in PID mode when nearly up to speed
	-Add joystick set mode
	-Analyse the speed data Jeff has
	-Check that the ready function does the right thing
AutoMode:
	-Test existing code
	-Create different modes
OI:
	-Selector for AutoModes
	-On/Off
