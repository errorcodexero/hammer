Etc:
	-Add logging to the onboard computer
	-parsing for log data (Ibrahin)
	-analysing log data after parsing
Shooter wheels:
	-Speed calibration
	-Add fallback systems
	-dynamic PID constant (Adrian)
Drivebase:
	-Complete location estimate code (DYLAN)
	-Calibrate and improve gyro (Austin)
	-Log when stuff gets clipped & figure out why it happens
Vision processing:
	-Send data over to the other machine that says when auto&teleop modes are
	-Integrate vision code(THOMAS)
	-Figure out how to talk over ethernet on the robot (TOM/THOMAS)
	-Make the controls work as if we had the data
		~For targets
		~For ball locations
OI:
	-Make it so that can detect when the Cypress board is present or not
	-suppress error messages about when the Cypress board is not active
	-test the rest of the OI override buttons
Ejector:
	-Make second eject mode work (AUSTIN)
AutoMode:
	-lights for auto on the robot test
Shooter:
	-Add down sensor to simulation
To be tested:
	-Spin up shooter and see if the shoot button glows when wheels come up to speed
		~Has been noted as not happening, possibly the wheels are just beneath up to speed
		~Possible error to autonomous.
